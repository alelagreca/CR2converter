# CR2converter
Runs on mac only for now...

The program basically runs "sips" tool through an user-friendly graphical interface.

## Installation
It is probably best if you set a new environment, for example with conda.
Install PySimpleGUI module:
```bash
pip3 install PySimpleGUI
```
## Usage
You can lauch the gui in your terminal with:
```bash
python3 cr2converter.py
```

When open, you will need to provide input and output directories. CR2 files in input directory will be display so you may choose some of them. If no selection is attempted, all files will be processed as input.

You may also change the default output format from jpg to any of tiff, png and more.

Hope it helps!!!
